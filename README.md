# website-node-express-jwt-auth
An authentication system using Node.js, Express, MongoDB &amp; JSON web tokens

This is a website where you can get information about magic. But the trick is that you can`t aquire any magic without registration process. Registration enables users to access a protected resource. Once the user signs up, JWT is sent, password is hashed and stored in database. Meanwhile JWT is used to store user authenticity information for 24 hours session.
