# website-node-express-jwt-auth
An authentication system using Node.js, Express, MongoDB &amp; JSON web token

This is a website where you can get information about magic. But the trick is that you can`t aquire any magic without registration process. Registration lets users access the protected resource. Once the user signs up, JWT is sent, password is hashed and stored in database. Meanwhile JWT is used to store user's authentic information for 24 hours session.
